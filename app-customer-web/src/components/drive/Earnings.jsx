              When demand for rides increases in certain areas, you can earn
              more with ourÂ Demand Bonus. The Driver app highlights these
              high-demand zones, so you can plan your trips strategically and
              maximize your earnings.

              Choosing the best days and times to go online can make a
              significant difference, and it varies by city. For example,
              consider going online during commute times for more ride requests.

          <div>How are earnings calculated?</div>
          <div>
            Your payouts are influenced by three key factors: trip fares,
            promotions that provide extra cash, and tips from the riders you
            pick up
          </div>
        </div>
        <div>
          <div>It all starts with fares</div>
          <div>
            Fares are the amount you earn for completing a ride, and they vary
            depending on the time, region, or city.

            <div>Per-minute and per-mile</div>
            <div>
              In some cities, you'll earn a base fare, plus additional money for
              the time and distance you travel (these rates vary by city). Your
              earnings will be determined at the end of every trip, based on how
              long and how far you travel.

            <div>Upfront Fares</div>
            <div>
              In some cities, you can see how much you'll make and where you'll
              go before you accept a trip. Upfront Fares are calculated based on
              current driving conditions, like destination and demand. If
              there's unexpected traffic and the trip gets a lot longer, your
              fare will increase.

          <div>
            Regardless of your city or region, a few additional factors will
            determine how much you'll earn for each ride.

            Make extra money by accepting rides that passengers book in advance.
          </div>
          <div>Cancellations</div>
          <div>
            If a rider cancels after you've begun driving toward them, a
            cancellation fee is charged to the rider, and you're compensated for
            the inconvenience.
          </div>
          <div>Tolls</div>
          <div>
            When your vehicle incurs a qualifying toll or surcharge during a
            trip, the toll amount is added to the rider's fare and reimbursed to
            you.

              Demand Bonus zones in the Driver app to boost your income during
              peak times.
